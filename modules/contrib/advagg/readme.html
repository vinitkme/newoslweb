<h2 id="corefeaturesbenefits">CORE FEATURES &amp; BENEFITS</h2>

<ul>
    <li><p>AdvAgg for Drupal 8 has some significant differences from Drupal 7; instead
        of totally reworking asset handling, AdvAgg only applies some improvements.
        This is mostly because the core handling is much better. It is also better
        for compatibility with quite a few other modules such as http2<em>server</em>push.</p></li>

    <li><p>Url query string to turn off AdvAgg for that request. ?advagg=0 will
        turn off file optimization if the user has the "bypass advanced aggregation"
        permission. ?advagg=-1 will completely bypass all of Advanced CSS/JS
        Aggregations modules and submodules. ?advagg=1 will enable Advanced CSS/JS
        Aggregation if it is currently disabled.</p></li>

    <li><p>Button on the admin page for dropping a cookie that will turn off file
        optimization. Useful for theme development.</p></li>

    <li><p>Gzip support. All optimized files can be pre-compressed into a .gz file and
        served from Apache. This is faster then gzipping the file on each request.</p></li>

    <li><p>Brotli support. All optimized files can be pre-compressed with the newer
        brotli compression algorithm; this often shows close to 30% improvements
        in file size vs gzip. Requires the brotli php extension is installed.</p></li>

    <li><p>With various submodules substantially improved front end performance through
        minification of assets and other techniques can be achieved. Read more below.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="submoduleoverview">SUBMODULE OVERVIEW</h2>

<p>AdvAgg comes with quite a few submodules to do various tasks. Most are
    compatible with the vast majority of other mods but some may have conflicts.
    If so those are noted here and more details in the module's full write-ups.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">CONFIGURATION</h2>

<p>Settings page is located at: <code>admin/config/development/performance/advagg</code>.</p>

<h3 id="globaloptions">Global Options</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Enable Advanced Aggregation:</strong> You can quickly temporarily disable all
        AdvAgg functionality by un-checking this. For testing purposes, see also
        <a href="#testing">Testing AdvAgg</a>. [Default: enabled]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Use DNS Prefetch for external CSS/JS:</strong> If enabled places prefetch tags
        near the top of your html to trigger DNS look-ups as soon as possible on
        load. [Default: disabled]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Send immutable header for all optimized files:</strong> Include directives for
        Apache to send <a href="http://bitsup.blogspot.de/2016/05/cache-control-immutable.html">Cache-Control Immutable</a>
        headers for all optimized files. Only supported on Edge 15+ and Firefox 49+.
        In other browsers, they will have no effect, so can be safely enabled.
        [Default: enabled]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>AdvAgg Cache Settings:</strong>
        Development will scan all files for a change on every page load. Normal is
        fine for all use cases. Aggressive should be fine in almost all use cases.
        [Default: Normal]</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compressionoptions">Compression Options</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Gzip [CSS/JS] Assets:</strong> If enabled, AdvAgg will create gzip compressed
        version of every file that is generated. This will then be served if the
        users' browser supports it instead of the uncompressed file saving time
        and bandwidth. [Default: enabled]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Brotli Compress [CSS/JS] Assets:</strong> Only selectable if the non standard
        <a href="https://github.com/kjdev/php-ext-brotli">PHP brotli extension</a> is installed.
        If enabled, Advagg will create brotli compressed versions of every file that
        is generated. Moderately better compression ratios than Gzip, but lower
        server and browser support. [Default: disabled]</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cssoptions">CSS Options</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Combine CSS files by using media queries:</strong> If enabled, AdvAgg will add a
        media query wrapper to any file that needs it so that aggregation is more
        efficient. [Default: disabled]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Fix improperly set type:</strong> If type is external but does not start with
        http, https, or // change it to be type file. If type is file but it starts
        with http, https, or // change type to be external. [Default: enabled]</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="jsoptions">JS Options</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Fix improperly set type:</strong> If type is external but does not start with
        http, https, or // change it to be type file. If type is file but it starts
        with http, https, or // change type to be external.  [Default: enabled]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Do not change external to file if on same host:</strong> In rare cases, JS files
        may be on the same host but are actually still external such as served via
        a CDN.  [Default: disabled]</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cronoptions">CRON Options</h3>

<p>Unless you have a good understanding of what you are trying to do, probably
    better to leave these alone. For best performance, setting up an external cron
    task is better than relying on Drupal's built in "poor man's cron".</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Minimum amount of time between <code>advagg_cron()</code> runs:</strong> Set the minimum
        amount of time between <code>advagg_cron</code> runs. <code>advagg_cron</code> whenever you site
        cron runs, if less than the minimum time, will return before further
        processing. [Default: 1 day]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Delete aggregates modified more than a set time ago:</strong> Set how old to keep
        generated files for. Longer will have higher performance and with AdvAgg
        8.x-3.x should have no negatives except for possibly wasted disk space from
        rarely used or changed files. [Default: 1 month]</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="obscureoptions">Obscure Options</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Convert absolute paths to protocol relative paths:</strong> Only applies to
        external files, this will change any http:// or https:// based urls to use
        //. [Default: enabled]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Convert http:// to https://:</strong> Also only applies to external files and is
        mutually incompatible with <strong>Convert absolute paths to protocol relative
            paths</strong>. [Default: disabled]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Use "Options +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch":</strong> On some rare hosting configurations
        the AdvAgg htaccess files need to use <code>Options +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch</code>
        instead of the more common <code>Options +FollowSymlinks</code>. [Default: disabled]</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="informationpage">Information page</h2>

<p>Located at <code>admin/config/development/performance/advagg/info</code>. This page
    provides debugging information. There are no configuration options here.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Hook Theme Info:</strong> Displays the <code>preprocess_html</code> order.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Core Asset Hooks Implemented by Modules:</strong> List modules implementing the
        various core asset hook functions. <em>Note:</em> if a module does not use these
        but is changing things with assets beyond adding/removing, there is a much
        greater chance that there may be conflicts with AdvAgg especially with some
        of the submodules.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Get information about an optimized file:</strong> Enter the name of an optimized
        file and get back an array of information about the file including its
        original name and location.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="operationspage">Operations page</h2>

<p>Located at <code>admin/config/development/performance/advagg/operations</code>. This is a
    collection of commands to control the cache and manage testing of this
    module. In general this page is useful when troubleshooting some aggregation
    issues.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Aggregation Bypass Cookie:</strong> Toggle The "aggregation bypass cookie" for
        the current browser. If enabled will disable AdvAgg for the user for the
        period of time specified. It acts almost the same as adding ?advagg=0
        to every URL.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Cron Maintenance Tasks:</strong> Remove All Stale Files: Scan all files in the
        css/js optimized directories and remove old files. See also <code>Cron
            Options</code> on the Configuration Page.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="drasticmeasures">Drastic Measures</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Clear All Caches:</strong> Remove all data stored in the advagg cache, and delete
        all optimized files.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Increment Global Counter</strong>: Force the creation of all new files with new
        names by incrementing a global counter.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tipstricks">TIPS &amp; TRICKS</h2>

<h3 id="javascriptbookmarklet">JavaScript Bookmarklet</h3>

<p>You can use this JS code as a bookmarklet for toggling the AdvAgg URL parameter.
    See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet for more details.</p>

<pre><code>javascript:(function(){
  var loc = document.location.href,
      qs = document.location.search,
      regex_off = /\&amp;?advagg=-1/,
      goto = loc;
  if(qs.match(regex_off)) {
    goto = loc.replace(regex_off, '');
  } else {
    qs = qs ? qs + '&amp;advagg=-1' : '?advagg=-1';
    goto = document.location.pathname + qs;
  }
  window.location = goto;
})();
</code></pre>

<h1 id="advancedaggregatescssjsvalidator">ADVANCED AGGREGATES CSS/JS VALIDATOR</h1>

<h2 id="overview-1">OVERVIEW</h2>

<p>Validate CSS and or JS files in your site through a few different validators.</p>

<h2 id="csslint">CSSLint</h2>

<p>Use the CSSLint JavaScript and the Drupal 8 core .csslintrc settings to lint
    the selected file(s) from your site.</p>

<h2 id="w3orgcssvalidator">W3.org CSS VALIDATOR</h2>

<p><em>Warning: this has privacy implications. Specifically this sends your CSS to
    the W3 servers.</em></p>

<p>Use the W3.org CSS Validator to lint the selected file(s) from your site.</p>

<h2 id="jshint">JSHint</h2>

<p>Use the JSHint JavaScript to lint the files on your site.</p>

<h1 id="advancedaggregatesexternalminifier">ADVANCED AGGREGATES EXTERNAL MINIFIER</h1>

<h2 id="overview-2">OVERVIEW</h2>

<p><em>Warning: depending on permissions this presents a security risk due to using
    administrator configurable command line calls.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: May conflict with AdvAgg Minify CSS and or AdvAgg Minify JS depending on
    configuration. Don't use 2 minifiers on one asset type.</em></p>

<p>Minify CSS or JS through an otherwise unsupported method, with a configurable
    command line. This may not work on all servers depending on security settings.</p>

</ul>

<h1 id="advancedaggregatesminifycss">ADVANCED AGGREGATES MINIFY CSS</h1>

<h2 id="overview-3">OVERVIEW</h2>

<p>Minify CSS files using a 3rd party minifier; currently supports YUI
    (included) or the Core cleaning algorithm. YUI will lead to much smaller
    files sizes and is the recommended option - basically, if you aren't using it,
    you probably will get better performance without this sub-module enabled. The
    YUI Compressor included with Advanced Aggregates is slightly different from
    that found on GitHub (as of last check, one patch had not been applied to the
    GitHub version).</p>

<h2 id="configuration-3">CONFIGURATION</h2>

<p>Located at <code>admin/config/development/performance/advagg/css-minify</code></p>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Minification: Select a minifier:</strong> Choose between <code>Disabled</code>, <code>Core</code> and
        <code>YUI</code>. [Default: YUI]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Add licensing Comments:</strong> If enable will include comment with path to the
        original file in every optimized file. Better follows the spirit of GPL but
        not required to conform. Will increase file size slightly.
        [Default: Enabled]</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="advancedaggregatesminifyjavascript">ADVANCED AGGREGATES MINIFY JAVASCRIPT</h1>

<h2 id="overview-4">OVERVIEW</h2>

<p>Minify JavaScript files using a 3rd party minifier. AdvAgg includes a few
    and supports one faster compiled PHP extension. The options are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><a href="https://crisp.tweakblogs.net/blog/6861/jsmin%2B-version-14.html">JSMin +</a>:
        No installation required. Usually the second best minification, however it
        is the slowest supported option.</p></li>

    <li><p><a href="https://github.com/tedious/JShrink">JShrink</a>: No installation required,
        JShrink is reliable and has fairly comparable minification to JSMin.</p></li>

    <li><p><a href="https://github.com/tchwork/jsqueeze">JSqueeze</a>: No installation required,
        JSqueeze provides the most effective minification and is the fallback if
        another minification method fails. It is still fairly slow.</p></li>

    <li><p><a href="https://github.com/sqmk/pecl-jsmin">JSMin</a>: The fast compiled C extension
        for PHP. Supports PHP 5.3+ and 7.x. Must be installed separately. Much
        faster than the other options but slightly less reliable although that is
        mostly mitigated within AdvAgg. See below for more details.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuration-4">CONFIGURATION</h2>

<p>Located at <code>admin/config/development/performance/advagg/css-minify</code></p>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Minification: Select a minifier:</strong> Choose which minifier to user.
        [Default: Disabled]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Add licensing Comments:</strong> If enable will include comment with path to the
        original file in every optimized file. Better follows the spirit of GPL but
        not required to conform. Will increase file size slightly.
        [Default: Enabled]</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="jsminphpextension">JSMIN PHP EXTENSION</h2>

<p>The AdvAgg Minify JavaScript module can take advantage of jsmin.c if it is
    available and selected as minifier. In that case, JavaScript parsing and
    minimizing will be done in C instead of PHP dramatically speeding up the
    process. The JsMin extension can be found at
    <a href="https://github.com/sqmk/pecl-jsmin">GitHub</a>. There are instructions on
    installing and compiling it there. Note that if you are using PHP 7.x you'll
    need to use the <code>feature/php7</code> branch rather than the <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<h1 id="advancedaggregatesmodifier">ADVANCED AGGREGATES MODIFIER</h1>

<h2 id="overview-5">OVERVIEW</h2>

<p><em>Depending on tweaks applied this module may cause compatibility issues with
    other modules.</em></p>

<p>Includes additional tweaks that may not work for all sites such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Force preprocessing for all CSS/JS.</li>

    <li>Add defer tag to all JS.</li>

    <li>Defer CSS loading using <code>rel=preload</code> and JavaScript Polyfill.</li>

    <li>Add async tag to all or only local JavaScript.
        Some of these may significantly increase performance depending on your
        individual site. However, they include possibly dangerous and minimally
        tested options so use care and read warnings on each option if there are any.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuration-5">CONFIGURATION</h2>

<p>Located at <code>admin/config/development/performance/advagg/mod</code>.</p>

<h3 id="js">JS</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Enable preprocess on all JS:</strong> Enables optimization for all JavaScript
        files. <em>Warning:</em> this may not be compatible with all mod added files.
        In fact, it is incompatible with CKEditor JavaScript and specifically
        excludes it to prevent problems. [Default: Disabled]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Remove console logging from JS Files:</strong> Removes any calls to console.log()
        <em>Warning:</em> this is experimental. Will decrease file size and may improve
        performance. [Default: Disabled]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Optimize JavaScript Ordering:</strong> Re-order the JavaScript to improve
        aggregation. If you're not using aggregation, will have minimal effect.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Move all external scripts to the top of the execution order:</strong> Move
                external scripts to the be loaded first. [Default: Disabled]</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Move all browser conditional JavaScript to the bottom of the group:</strong>
                As browser conditional scripts are usually the last needed, this often
                provides better front-end performance. [Default: Disabled]</p></li></ul></li>

    <li><p><strong>Adjust JavaScript Location and Execution:</strong> Mostly safe but may cause
        serious issues depending on your specific site configuration. Due to changes
        in Drupal 8 these options are mostly irrelevant but may still have some
        small effect.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Deferred JavaScript Execution:</strong> Add the defer tag to all or only
                local scripts. [Default: Disabled]</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Experimental settings:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Asynchronous JavaScript Execution:</strong> Add the async tag to all
                        JavaScript. <em>Warning:</em> this may cause issues! [Default: Disabled]</p></li>

                    <li><p><strong>Group Async JavaScript:</strong> Group any Async Javascript together.
                        May lead to better aggregates if only some of your scripts are being
                        loaded asynchronously otherwise irrelevant. [Default: Disabled]</p></li></ul></li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="css">CSS</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Enable preprocess on all CSS:</strong> Enables optimization for all CSS files.
        <em>Warning:</em> this may not be compatible with all mod added files, although
        there are no known cases of it causing problems at this time.
        [Default: Disabled]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Optimize CSS Ordering:</strong> Re-order the CSS to improve
        aggregation. If you're not using aggregation, will have minimal effect.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Move all external CSS to the top of the execution order:</strong> Move

<h2 id="overview-6">OVERVIEW</h2>

<p><em>This module may have conflicts with other modules if it is enabled.</em></p>

<p>Includes additional functionality to improve Drupal compatibility with old
    versions of Internet Explorer (6-9). No currently known compatibility issues
    however due to method required to override core on this it is easily possible
    that there are other modules that do conflict.</p>

<p>This module prevents CSS aggregates from being produced with more than 4095
    (or a configured value) selectors as <strong>old</strong> Internet Explorer versions do not
    handle more than 4095 selectors in an individual file.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-6">CONFIGURATION</h2>

<p>Located at <code>admin/config/development/performance/advagg/old_ie_compatibility</code>.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Prevent more than [number] CSS selectors in an aggregate CSS file:</strong>
        [Default: enabled]</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Selector count limit:</strong> The maximum number of selectors to allow in an
        aggregate CSS file. [Default 4095]</p></li>
